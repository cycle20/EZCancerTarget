# Introduction

`EZCancerTarget` provides detailed biological information on the selected set of
target molecules using open-access databases, such as _UniProt_, _GeneCards_,
_Gene Ontology_ and _STRING_. This way, the user receives a concise summary on
the biological relevance of every target, that is explicitly important for
researchers who are not experts in molecular biology.

## Running with no installation

### Input Google Spreadsheet

[EZCancerTarget - Target INPUT table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oQtWxPJASB-WfwqnyBJr3woXmv03bu3iSzIrKyK2-t8/) - the easiest way to provide input dataset to ```EZCancerTarget``` workflow and start it on GitHub.

Its access requires

* a Google account,
* an editor permission,
* cooperations with other users to avoid unintended changes of initial dataset.

### Result page and workflow status check

* Result of recent targets: [index.target.with.data.html](https://cycle20.github.io/EZCancerTarget/index.target.with.data.html)
* [Baseline version of result page](https://cycle20.github.io/EZCancerTarget/baseline/index.target.with.data.html)
* [Workflow results](https://github.com/cycle20/EZCancerTarget/actions/workflows/clue.yml) - list of each workflow run on GitHub.
