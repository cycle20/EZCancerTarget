# Overview

`EZCancerTarget` provides detailed biological information on the selected set of
target molecules using open-access databases, such as _UniProt_, _GeneCards_,
_Gene Ontology_ and _STRING_. This way, the user receives a concise summary on
the biological relevance of every target, that is explicitly important for
researchers who are not experts in molecular biology.
